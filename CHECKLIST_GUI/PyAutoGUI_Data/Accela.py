#I want to make a program that will retreive Accela information, the only problem is that I dont have an API key, so I will brute force.

#Use PyAutoGUI or Selenium to navigate through Accela and get the data.

#first make it be able to navigate through Accela and find: Permit Number, Address, and Parcel Number
#then be able to show the parcel number in PCPAO.gov
#then be able to show permits on said Parcel
#then show me Pros
#then show me if it's a Private Provider
